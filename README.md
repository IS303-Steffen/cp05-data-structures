## Prompt for Reviewing with AI
Put the following prompt into your preferred generative AI service:
> I am a student in an introductory programming course learning Python. I am a beginner, and I want you to act as my tutor, correcting me when I make mistakes and explaining concepts in simple language. After this message, I will describe a concept, and I want you to tell me if my description is right and correct me on any misconceptions I have.

Then, explain any of the concepts we went over today in your own words and see if you can accurately describe that concept.
